# Elysium Engine #
An OpenGL Rendering Engine with an ImGui Interface.

It hosts all the necessary features to develop simple desktop applications.

This is a simplified version of the previous [Astra Engine](https://gitlab.com/jszajek/astra) to refocus the project towards desktop applications compared to specialized game engine requirements.

**Disclaimer:** This implementation follows various tutorials referenced below and is mainly a personal exercise
to learn about the involved api, pipelines, and algorithms.
